# Figma React CLI

Transform Figma UI into React components

## Problems

### 'center' constraints works in React-Native/Web differently than in Figma.

In Figma 'center' constraint maintains the objectâ€™s position, relative to the center of the frame.
In Figma it works like position widget on center and then move it on x (or y) value.
But in app, if we use flex, 'center' constraint and margin, margin will increase widget's size, 
and still position such bigger widget on center.
